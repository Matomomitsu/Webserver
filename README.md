"WEBSERV is the penultimate project before specialization in the general development curriculum at 42.

WEBSERV is a project where an HTTP server was created, allowing GET, POST, and DELETE requests. It handles common server responses such as 404 and 403. The process takes an input file with server configurations, such as port and host. When the program starts, the ports and host are open and waiting for requests.

Additionally, the project includes CGI and folder verification in autoindex mode.

To run it, simply execute the 'MAKE' command, followed by: './webserv utils/input.txt'

Note: 'utils/input.txt' is the location for the configuration file."
